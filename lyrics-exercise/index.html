            <p>
            It's not that easy bein' green<br>
            Having to spend each day the color of the leaves<br>
            When I think it could be nicer bein' red or yellow or gold<br>
            Or something much more colorful like that
            </p>

            <p class="section">[Verse 2]</p>
            <p>
            It's not easy bein' green<br>
            It seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things<br>
            And people tend to pass you over<br>
            'Cause you're not standin' out<br>
            Like flashy sparkles on the water<br>
            Or stars in the sky
            </p>

            <p class="section">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
            <p>
            But green is the color of spring<br>
            And green can be cool and friendly-like
            </p>

            <p class="section">[Chorus]</p>
            <p>
            And green can be big like an ocean<br>
            Or important like a mountain<br>
            Or tall like a tree<br>
            When green is all there is to be<br>
            It could make you wonder why<br>
            But why wonder, why wonder?<br>
            I am green and it'll do fine<br>
            It's beautiful<br>
            And I think it's what I want to be
            </p>
